# ECM1410 Object-Oriented Programming - Pair Programming Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements pair programming methodology as part of the ECM1410 Object-Oriented Programming coursework at the University of Exeter. Pair programming is an agile software development technique where two developers work together on a single machine to solve programming problems collaboratively.

### Key Principles
- Both developers work on a **single machine** (side-by-side or remote screen sharing)
- Roles are **switched frequently** during development
- Continuous communication and discussion of solutions and design approaches
- Knowledge sharing between team members

### Benefits
- Fewer bugs in final code
- More concise and efficient programs
- Faster development time
- Enhanced knowledge sharing and learning

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK 17 or higher)
- IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
- Git for version control

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/ECM1410-PairProgramming.git
cd ECM1410-PairProgramming
```

2. Import project into your preferred IDE
3. Ensure both team members have access to the shared development environment

### Development Workflow
1. **Minimum requirement:** Two pair-programming sessions in the first week
2. Regular role switching between driver and observer
3. Collaborative problem-solving and code review
4. Continuous integration of feedback and improvements

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Compile and run tests
javac -cp . src/main/java/**/*.java
java -cp . [MainClassName]

# Run specific test
javac -cp . src/test/java/**/*.java
java -cp . [TestClassName]
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java 17
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Testing Framework:** JUnit (if applicable)

## Learning Outcomes

Through this pair programming experience, we have gained:
- Enhanced collaborative development skills
- Improved code quality through real-time review
- Better understanding of different problem-solving approaches
- Experience with agile development methodologies
- Strengthened communication and teamwork abilities

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines

### Communication
- Regular check-ins and progress updates
- Prompt response to emails and messages (within 24 hours)
- Scheduled pair programming sessions with agreed timing

### Conflict Resolution
- Open discussion of any disagreements
- Focus on code quality and project goals
- Escalation to Dr. Pacheco if necessary

### Academic Integrity
- No collaboration with students outside our pair
- All work is original and properly attributed
- Adherence to University of Exeter academic misconduct policies

For any issues with pair collaboration or coursework queries, contact the module coordinator within one week of coursework release.
